# OOP Workshop - Car Dealership

## Preface

Before you start coding, read this document from top to bottom. It has some valuable information that will make your work easier.

## Description

Implement a vehicle tracking system for a famous car dealership called `Safe Travel`. Currently, there are three types of vehicles in this project - `Car`, `Motorcycle`, and `Truck`. There are also `Users` and `Comments`. 

Every user has a collection of vehicles and every vehicle in this collection has a collection of comments. The users can add vehicles and comments to the respective collections or remove them.

Every user should register and log in before doing anything in the Car Dealership. If they are not logged-in or another user is currently logged-in, the former cannot do anything. This is already implemented and you are not expected to do anything (but you can still figure out how it works :) ).

What you need to do is to build the OO classes hierarchy. Make sure to follow the object-oriented programming best practices and conventions discussed during the lectures. 

You are given a few interfaces that you should connect in a reasonable hierarchy, implement and use as a basis of your code. Avoid duplicated code through abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism, and encapsulate all fields correctly.

The application already accepts commands and outputs text for each submitted command.  

## Architecture

The Car Dealership already has a working Engine. **You do not have to touch anything in it.** Just use it.

Your focus should be on the **models** packages, where you must finish the already created classes using the provided interfaces in the **contracts** package.

You are given **all** Java interfaces that you need (`Vehicle`, `Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Truck`).

## Models

> Note: All validation intervals are inclusive (closed).

### **Car**

- `make` - a string with a length between `2` and `15` symbols.
- `model` - a string with а length between `1` and `15` symbols.
- `price` - a number between `0.0` and `1000000.0`.
- `seats` - a number between `1` and `10`.
- `wheels count` are always `4`.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
#. Car:
Make: {make}
Model: {model}
Wheels: {wheels}
Price: ${price}
Seats: {seats}
```

### **Motorcycle**

- `make` - a string with а length between `2` and `15` symbols.
- `model` - a string with а length between `1` and `15` symbols.
- `price` - a number between `0.0` and `1000000.0`.
- `category` - a string with а length between `3` and `10` symbols.
- `wheels count` are always `2`.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
#. Motorcycle:
Make: {make}
Model: {model}
Wheels: {wheels}
Price: ${price}
Category: {category}
```

### **Truck**

- `make` - a string with а length between `2` and `15` symbols.
- `model` - a string with а length between `1` and `15` symbols.
- `price` - a number between `0.0` and `1000000.0`.
- `weight capacity` - a number between `1` and `100`.
- `wheels count` are always `8`.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
#. Truck:
Make: {make}
Model: {model}
Wheels: {wheels}
Price: ${price}
Weight Capacity: {weightCapacity}t
```

### **User**

- `username` - a string with а length between `2` and `20` symbols and a certain pattern to be followed.
- `first name` - a string with а length between `2` and `20` symbols.
- `last name` - a string with а length between `2` and `20` symbols.
- `password` - a string with а length between `5` and `30` symbols a certain pattern to be followed.
- a collection of vehicles.
- `User role` - an enum of type `[Normal, VIP, or Admin]`:
   - If the user is an admin, they cannot add a vehicle
   - If the user is not VIP, they cannot add more than `5` vehicles

- The users can **AddVehicle**, **RemoveVehicle**, **AddComment** and **RemoveComment**
- Every user has a collection of `Vehicles` and every `Vehicle` in this collection has a collection of `Comments`.
- Users should **register** and **login** before doing anything in the Car Dealership. If a user is not logged-in or another one is logged-in, the former cannot do anything in the system.

- Printing
	- For the `User` class:

`Username: {Username}, FullName: {FirstName} {LastName}, Role: {Role}`

	- For all vehicles of the user:

```none
--USER {Username}--
1. {Vehicle type}:
Make: {make}
Model: {model}
Wheels: {wheels}
Price: ${price}
Category/Weight capacity/Seats: {category/weight capacity/seats}
--COMMENTS--
----------
{Content}
User: {Comment Username}
----------
----------
{Content}
User: {Comment username}
----------
--COMMENTS--
2. {Vehicle type}:
Make: {make}
Model: {model}
Wheels: {wheels}
Price: ${price}
Category/Weight capacity/Seats: {category/weight capacity/seats}
--NO COMMENTS--
```

### **Comment**

- `author`
- `content` - a string with а length between `3` and `200` symbols.
- Should be convertible to **String** in the format:

```none
----------
{Content}
User: {Comment username}
----------
```

### **Additional Validations**

**The error messages and all the constraints for each field that must be validated can be *found in the example output*. If you are unsure about some constraints, run the tests. You already have the error messages in the respective classes.**

- **Vehicle validation**
  - Make and model length.
  - Price range.
  - Wheels count.
  - Seats count (for car).
  - Category length (for motorcycle).
  - Weight capacity (for truck).

- **Comment validation**
  - Content.

- **User Validation**
  - Username length.
  - FirstName length.
  - LastName length.
  - Password length.

**All properties in the above classes are mandatory (cannot be empty).**

- **User actions**
	- Adding a vehicle
		- If the user is admin, they cannot add a vehicle
		- If the user is not VIP, they cannot add more than `5` vehicles

	- Adding a comment
		- Just add the comment to the list

	- Removing a vehicle
		- Just remove the vehicle from the list

	- Removing a comment
		- If the author of the comment is not the current user, they cannot remove it

- **The dashes separating the comments are exactly 10.**
- **Price has `$` in front of the value and has no trailing zeros** *(e.g. `Price: $10000`)*

*Hint: You can use this method found in the `FormattingHelpers` class for removing trailing zeros:*

```java
public static String removeTrailingZerosFromDouble(double number) {
    BigDecimal num = BigDecimal.valueOf(number).stripTrailingZeros();
    return num.toPlainString();
}
```

- **The weight capacity has `t` after the value** *(e.g. `Weight capacity: 40t`)*
- **Look into the example below to get better understanding of the printing format.**

## Commands

Currently, the engine supports the following commands:

- **RegisterUser** `[username] [firstName] [lastName] [password] [role]` - registers a user if there is no such user already.
- **Login** `[username] [password]` - logs in a user if they are not already logged-in and there is such a registered user.
- **Logout** - logs out the currently logged-in user.
- **AddVehicle** `[type] [make] [model] [price] [category/seats/weightCapacity]` - adds a vehicle to the current user. The fourth parameter depends on the type of the vehicle.
- **RemoveVehicle** `[vehicleIndex]` - removes the vehicle on that index if there is such.
- **AddComment** `[content] [author] [vehicleIndex]` - adds a comment with the content provided to the vehicle with that index and sets the author.
- **RemoveComment** `[vehicleIndex] [commentIndex] [username]` - removes the comment from the vehicle.
- **ShowVehicles** `[username]` - shows all the vehicles of a user.

Commands that you should implement yourself:
- **ShowUsers** - shows all registered users.

>Note: All commands return **appropriate success messages**. The `Engine` returns **appropriate error messages** in case of an invalid operation or error.

## Constraints

You should implement the empty classes. You can add new classes where needed and modify any of the existing code under the **models** package if necessary.

## Unit Tests

- You have been given unit tests to keep track of your progress. Run them by right-clicking the **tests** package and selecting **Run 'All Tests'**.
- If you get stuck, check out the tests' names to guide you on what to do.
 
> Note: Be careful not to change anything in the **tests** folder.

## Step by step guide

Before starting your work, build the project and see what `TODO`s it has. 

1. Implement all interfaces.

- Look at the **contracts** folder and decide how to use each of the interfaces there.
- **HINT:** some interfaces are segregated (separated into several interfaces) like the `Priceable` interface.

2.Implement the classes in which there is a `TODO`.
**Hint:** Implement `Vehicles` classes first, then `print()` methods and finally `ShowUsersCommand`.
**Hint:** You can check all `TODO`s in a project from the TODO tab on bottom left (may vary for different IDE or different versions of the same IDE)

3. Validate all properties according to the guidelines set above.

- **HINT FOR USERIMPL:** Use UsernamePattern = "^[A-Za-z0-9]+$"; PasswordPattern = "^[A-Za-z0-9@*_-]+$"; You already have it in the class. 
  See `ValidationHelpers` class for the method needed.

4. Try running the tests. You can run them by class in order to orient yourself more easily.

5. Implement printing.

- Instead of a `print()` method, you need to override `toString()` in order to output the classes in the console.

6. Implement the methods inside the `UserImpl` class.
